        <p> My name is Christie Yoon. I attended Martinson College in California a few years ago to work in the healthcare field. It allowed me to discover more about myself regarding work ethics. While I was in college, my professor commended me for being an excellent student and had even said that he wished all of his students were like me. That was because I exerted myself and made it my goal to be the top of my class. My professor also mentioned to me that he thought I would have a very successful career. Afterward, I had begun my two-month externship at St. Joseph Hospital in California. Again, I took the initiative to learn as much as I could with the time that I had, and my managers and co-workers began to notice on how accurate my work was despite being a student. Once my externship concluded, I was hired for my first job as a traveling technician, and I was sent to UAB Hospital in Alabama. Although health care workers can be pushed to focus on quantity, I focused on quality throughout my entire career. Therefore, I was considered an asset by my supervisors and managers. They noticed my thoroughness and diligence, and they relied on me to complete my duties with no mistakes rather than those around me with many more years of experience.

				 <p> Although I enjoyed my job, I was not able to travel any longer and I needed more stability in my life. I was in the middle of a huge life change, and I had to move to another state to start my life as a newlywed. Then I started to think about creating a new career path for myself, as I have only been in three different types of jobs my whole life. I wanted to try something that would push me out of my comfort zone while having to do with computer technology, as it is a quickly growing field.

       <p> With software engineering, it would be of the utmost importance to build high-quality software, and I am confident that I would be able to provide that. I enjoy putting in real efforts and my time to get what needs to be done correctly and accomplishing my goals in regards to my career. I am convinced that going into this field will be a good challenge for me, and I always wanted to be involved in a career that would encourage me to become more of an innovative person. After I did research on different online programs for software engineering, I set my mind on attending Flatiron School because I wanted to belong to an educational institution that sets high standards for their students.
